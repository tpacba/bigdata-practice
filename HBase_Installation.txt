Regions
-------
Regions are the tables that are split up 
and spread across the region servers.

RegionServers
-------------
Software processes (often called daemons) 
you activate to store and retrieve data in HBase (Hadoop Database).

The region servers have regions that -

Communicate with the client.
Handle read and write requests for all the regions under it.
Decide the size of the region by following the region size thresholds.


HMaster
------------
Is responsible for region assignment 
as well as DDL (create, delete tables) operations.


Quorum
------
The Quorum is a list of hosts on which ZooKeeper servers are running.


HBase Tables – Logical collection of rows stored in individual partitions known as Regions.
HBase Row – Instance of data in a table.
RowKey -Every entry in an HBase table is identified and indexed by a RowKey.
Columns - For every RowKey an unlimited number of attributes can be stored.
Column Family – Data in rows is grouped together as column families and all columns are stored together in a low level storage file known as HFile.
