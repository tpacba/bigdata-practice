Nifi task(Submission: Wednesday(2/24) )
----------
1. FTP a file from remote server to your local server.
2. Move it to HDFS
3. Move this data from HDFS to mysql/postgres/mssql/hive external database

MAP REDUCE:
- framework based on key value
- disadvantage of slow processing, dependant on disc input & output

SPARK:
- in-memory distributed computing framework used for faster parallel computing and with lazy evaluation
- much faster processing in RAM primarily rather than disc, slightly slower running on secondary disc
- only processing, no storage (depends on hdfs,aws-s3,azure cloud,oraclegen2,gcs,etc. for storage)
- entire framework is written in scala (JVM processes)
- can develop spark program using java,scala,python,R,(maybe .NET)
- lazy evaluation: transformations/processes depends on the end 'action' trigger


SPARK ARCHITECTURE:
- 'driver' running on master node, no high availability
- 'executor' running on worker node, has distributed-parallel computing
- driver: 
1. negotiating resources with the cluster manager(YARN,mesos,spark-standalone,kubernetes) & nodemanager(containers,application-master,task)
2. creating the DAG(vertices/RDD & edges/narrow-wide-transformations),prepares logical plan for physical evaluation
a. narrow-transformation: no shuffling-movement of data from one node to another worker node
b. wide-transformation: computation & communication between worker nodes, slower processing and larger bandwidth
- jobs > stages > tasks
- every action = new job created
- stages = new wide transformation
- task = lowest unit of work in spark program

EXECUTOR:
- similar to a JVM processor
- submitted through spark-submit, optimally decided by the you the developer
- allocates for clusters of missions
- make sure to allocate 40% space for hadoop daemons and yarn processes and off heap memory head(for garbage collection), will run into out of memory error
- maximum give 5 core to 1 executor

STORAGE LEVELS:
- 'cache' is memory only
- 'persist' is disc only, memory & disc, memory and disc serialized, memory and disc deserialized
- default cache first till you run out, then persist for the rest

DATATYPES:
- RDD = resilient distributed dataset, basic construct in spark, distributed among the worker nodes, resilient recreation of partitions at loss
- DATAFRAME = two dimensional table/view of data which has schema
- DATASETS = strictly typed collection of data, not applicable for python

CATALYST OPTIMIZER,TUNGSTEN
- internal performance tuning
1.catalyst optimizer:
a. rule-based optimization: preparing the logical plan
b. cost-based optimization: keep track of historical information
2. tungsten: handling optimal cpu and memory

SPARK SESSION:
1. SPARK SESSION - to user dataframe api
2. SPARK CONTEXT - to use RDD api
3. SPARK CONF - config, execture drive,
4. HIVE CONTEXT - "Hive query"
SQL CONTEXT - "query"
